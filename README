firefox extension that:
  searches <a> html element and downloads file
  if src attribute has *.dxf or *.tap
  if src attribute has *.zip it will
  unzip and search for *.dxf and *.tap files before
  it attempts to parse and then convert
  Gcode(.tap) to an <img> and Dxf to an <svg>
  which will then be appended to the original <a>

quality of life changes:
  autostarts on file:// protocol (with a delay between each <a> link) and adds start/stop buttons
  added context menu on websites which says CTRL+contextmenu (script checks for href=*.dxf before it continues)
